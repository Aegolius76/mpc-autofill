    <h1>Community Contributions</h1>
    <p>
        This website is only possible because of the contributions of hard-working members of the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mpcproxies/">MPC Reddit community</a>.
        <br>
        Currently, there are <b>{{ total_count }}</b> images in the database. The database is automatically synced
        with all Drives every Sunday to ensure all changes are recorded.
        <br>
        The community Google Drives hooked up to this website, and an overview of their contributions, are included
        below.
        <br>
        If you'd like to have your drive added to the site, shoot me a message on
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chilli_Axe/">Reddit</a>! I'd love to make this website's
        card database as comprehensive as possible.
